# The final frontier

These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, **to boldly go where no one has gone before!** In the distant future of the _Star Trek_ universe, humanity has developed advanced technologies that allow them to travel to the far reaches of the galaxy.

They encounter a wide variety of alien species, some friendly and some hostile, and they use their knowledge and diplomacy to navigate these encounters. The crew of the Enterprise, under the command of [Captain James T. Kirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk), faces many challenges and adventures as they explore the unknown, but their unwavering determination and sense of duty propels them forward.

The idea of space exploration and the possibilities of encountering different civilization is a key theme in _Star Trek_ series, it also reflects the hope for a better future for humanity and the spirit of exploration and discovery.

`Live long and prosper`
